Message from the President on behalf of the Senior Management Team

To all members of the University

Hot on the heels of the wonderful news about this year's admissions results, showing for example that as well as all 12 perfect scorers in the HKDSE choosing to come to HKU, 82% of the 689 top scorers that wish to study Medicine chose HKU and an extraordinary 98% of those wanting to study Law chose HKU, I have some more great news. The University of Hong Kong has an incredible nine (9) of the world's top cited scientific researchers. It is noteworthy that no other Hong Kong institution has more than 3, but in line with my oft-repeated assertion that we should aspire to global greatness and not just local dominance, it is worth noting that our increase from 5 of the most highly cited scientific researchers last year to 9 this year equates to an "indicative" world ranking of 58th compared to 110th in 2014. The advantages of this particular ranking are that the methodology is objective and the assessment period is 11 years, so that these data can be considered more robust than the standard league tables which depend upon subjective assessments and annual data gathering with frequent methodological changes. For further details, see [http://highlycited.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20211229061839/http://highlycited.com/).

My very sincere congratulations to Kwok-hung Chan, Guan Yi, James Lam, Malik Peiris, Leo Poon, Nagendra Shah, Min Sun, Yuen Kwok Yung and Guochun Zhao: we are very proud of them! Congratulations also to all the colleagues in their teams that have contributed to the success.

This message also gives me a timely opportunity to reassure all academic staff of the University, if reassurance is needed, that The University of Hong Kong continues to be a place where academic freedom is cherished and protected, where academic staff are encouraged to pursue whatever subjects their interests dictate, irrespective of how controversial they may be, and that all assessments of credentials and performance will be based on academic merit according to internationally recognised standards. Despite recent controversies, the University is striding forward and I am very optimistic that the future is bright.

The data referred to above show that HKU is currently sought after by the brightest students and populated by some of the world's most prominent scientists. My recent experience shows me that HKU is seen as an attractive place to work and study, a partner of choice for some of the world's top universities and a university that has the potential to be one of the world's best. Don't let anyone suggest otherwise!

With best personal regards,  
Professor Peter Mathieson  
President and Vice-Chancellor
