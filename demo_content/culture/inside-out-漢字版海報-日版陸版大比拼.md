PIXAR最新作品《玩轉腦朋友》（Inside Out）將於下月6日在大陸上映，大陸昨日發佈一批新海報，將戲中五個情緒角色，與他們的名字結合，在大陸網絡上頗獲好評；不過，[有網民將這一系列海報，與該片在日本上映時推出的漢字海報作比較](http://web.archive.org/web/20210629052841/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154215026324128&set=a.10150281561249128.403824.628184127&type=1&theater)，認為日版在更加美觀、掌握到漢字的精髓，引起熱議，不少人留言認為大陸的簡體字版遠遜日本版，但也有人不同意。

下為昨日公佈的大陸官方漢字版海報：

紫舟為日本著名書法家，經常獲邀題字，如2010年由福山雅治主演的NHK大河劇《龍馬傳》劇名，就是出自她手筆；她亦曾為多個日本政府部門推廣計劃設計字體。紫舟亦愛以書法結合不同的展現形式，將立體文字雕塑，投影等現代方式，與傳統書法之美結合。
