> 小津安二郎《秋刀魚之味》劇照

當我是1，你是99

當我把稀釋的漂白水倒進浴室的Ｕ型去水位  
當我第23次用酒精紙巾揩抹雙手  
當我嘗試再用點力，擦掉杯沿咖啡或茶的陳跡  
今早，床腳下的灰，有一張收據

而幼腳蜘蛛大模大樣爬進相架背後露出便便大腹  
給昨夜弄疲了的蜻蜓在光管下仰臥  
我在網上第129次重看關於自己的信息  
化名嘲諷，攻擊，然後矢口否認  
自己是另一個自己很快便忘記的名字

當我拉開戴久了的口罩嗅到一股噁心的氣味  
當我打開房子的頂蓋，警告上面一個也不認識的鄰居  
當我開始學懂在骨碌碌的眼球中辨識新的符號  
今早，電梯門打開，人群匆匆向兩邊的空氣稀釋

而一聲咳嗽可以免費換取身邊偌大的空間  
維園一株樹木獨對躲開了的玻璃森林  
我走過的路給自來水猛烈攻擊，電梯扶手  
迎接盡頭塑料手套一團一團濡濡濕濕  
圖書館緊急疏散前，我被一列一列靈魂拒絕

當我攤開地圖發現走過的地方從未走過  
當我遮蓋眉眼露出下半臉的白色口罩  
今早，當我揭開報章找尋醫院的新鮮數字  
一隻僵固的蜉蝣正把蜘蛛驅逐出游絲

而我不敢開窗只得翻檢儲物櫃和抽屜  
發現小津的秋刀魚塵封在希治閣的後窗  
我問我們的結婚錄像要不要轉成光碟  
你說你高聲地說誰看呢誰還看呢我說  
甚麼甚麼隔著門廊走道隔著那麼多東西

當我用稀釋的漂白水洗過我們走過的地方  
當我第221次用酒精抹盡所有扶手  
當我取出萬能膠，嘗試黏回暴雨後霉脫的牆紙  
今早，過期月結單內，有蟑螂乾屍

當你是1，而我是99

**1：99**

When I am 1, you are 99

When I poured the diluted bleach into the U-shape gutter in the bathroom  
When I used the alcoholic tissues to wipe my hands for the 23rd time  
When I put more effort, into rubbing off the coffee and tea remains at the ridge of the mug  
This morning, there was dust near one of the legs of my bed, and a receipt

Then, a spider with thin legs openly climbed behind a photo frame and showed his broad tummy  
A dragonfly made tired by night lied on its back below  
I read over again my own private message for the 129th time on the Internet  
Anonymous irony, attack, and denial  
I am just another name easily forgotten by myself

When I unveiled my face mask that I had worn for a long time, I could detect an intolerable odor  
When I opened the top of a house, I warned against every strange neighbor  
When I started to learn identifying new symbols among all those rolling eyeballs  
This morning, when the lift door opened, people spread out into the air in haste

Then, a brief cough could redeem a huge space free of charge  
A tree in Victoria Park confront the glass forest which hid itself  
The path I had walked past was fiercely attacked by tap water, the escalator handrail  
greeted clouds of wetness through plastic gloves at its end  
Before the emergency evacuation in the library, I was refused by queues of souls

When I opened a map, I discovered that I had not been to the places I passed by  
When I covered up my eyebrows and eyes, I showed the white mask on the lower part of my face  
This morning, when I opened the newspaper to find out the new figures released by the hospital  
a rigid mayfly was expelling a spider from its spider web

But I dared not open the window. I examined my lockers and drawers  
and discovered that Yasujirō’s saury was locked inside the back window of Hitchcock  
I asked if our video on the wedding day needed to be transferred to a cd-rom  
You said you shouted loudly who would watch and who would still watch it I said  
What? What? Behind the doors and corridors so many things

When I used diluted bleach to clean the places where we had been to  
When I used alcohol cleanser to wipe all the handles for the 221st time  
When I took out the all-purpose adhesive, and tried to stick back the wallpaper properly after the thunderstorm  
This morning, an expired monthly statement, was stuck with the dried corpse of a cockroach

When you are 1, I am 99
