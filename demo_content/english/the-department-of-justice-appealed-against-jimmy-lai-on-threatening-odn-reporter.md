The Department of Justice (DoJ) decided to appeal against Next Digital founder Jimmy Lai, who was clear just two weeks ago of the acquittal of verbally threatening an Oriental Daily News reporter during the June 4 gathering in 2017.

In response to the enquiry of Stand News, the Department of Justice said it field an appeal against the ruling based on Article 105 of the Magistrates Ordinance.

"As the case's legal proceedings remain ongoing, it is not appropriate for the DoJ to comment further," it added.

Jimmy Lai’s lieutenant Mark Simon said he was just informed that the recent innocent verdict of Jimmy Lai was appealed. In his twitter, he criticized Teresa Cheng, the Secretary of Justice, is a full China Communist Party tool and immense damage was done on the Hong Kong legal system.

During the annual June 4th gathering at Victoria Park, Lai was said to threaten an Oriental Daily News reporter by saying "I will find someone to 'fix' you."

Lai denied the charge, which West Kowloon magistrate May Chung Ming-sun ruled not guilty on September 3.

In her verdict, Chung said she did not believe Lai said he would say “I will find someone to fix you” because there was no such evidence in the court submission. Although Lai confirmed this saying in the video recording testimony, the magistrate said it did not mean Lai admitted everything because he could not recall the exact saying.
