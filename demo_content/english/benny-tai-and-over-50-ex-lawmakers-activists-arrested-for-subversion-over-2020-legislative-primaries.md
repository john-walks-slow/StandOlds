Over 50 people involved in democratic primaries last year including Benny Tai, Alvin Yeung, Tiffany Yuen and Gwyneth Ho were arrested this morning (January 6).

According to the social media posts by various activists and ex-lawmakers under arrest, they were arrested over organisation and participation in the democratic primaries for the 2020 Legislative Council election, which were postponed by the government later last year. They were alleged for subversion by electing 35 lawmakers into the legislature who would veto government budgets to force the resignation of the Chief Executive Carrie Lam .

In addition to the former HKU scholar Benny Tai, who initiated the primaries, those arrested also included former lawmaker Au Nok-hin, Power for Democracy members Andrew Chiu, Ben Chung and John Clancey, who were also actively involved in the primaries.

Other arrested include District Councilors Clarisse Yeung, Wong Pak-yu and Lester Shum, who were taken to their office for investigation this morning. Assistant to Yeung said the police went to her home for arrest and tried to break into her office. The gate of the office were seen to be damaged.

In addition, the Facebook administrator for the imprisoned activist Joshua Wong, said the police also searched Wong’s home for over an hour. Reports earlier today suggested that academician Robert Chung, who organized the primaries, was arrested but Chung was only asked to assist in the investigation.

The police also reached a few media outlets including Stand News, Hong Kong In-media and Apple Daily and asked the persons-in-charge to sign documents related to a national security investigation. 

Chung Kim-wah, deputy chief executive of Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute told Stand News that all the personal information of the voters who participated in the primaries was completely destroyed.

Nathan Law, who participated the primaries but now in United Kingdom, criticized that the government have elevated the National Security Law into the next level by suppressing political freedom and freedom of speech.
