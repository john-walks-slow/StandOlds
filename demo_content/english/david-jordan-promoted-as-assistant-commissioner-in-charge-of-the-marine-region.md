> 莊定賢 David Jordan

David Jordan, the Chief Superintendent of Police in charge of several police operations and the Commander in chief of the Special Tactical Squad during the anti-extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement last year, is promoted as the Assistant Commissioner in charge of the Marine Region.

Former chairmen of Demosistō Nathan Law said he was very disappointed about the promotion, and will continue to work with Luke de Pulford, commissioner of the British Conservative Party's human rights commission, to prepare a private prosecution of the British-Hong Kong police.

According to the latest issue (Sep 16) of the OffBeat Bulletin of the Hong Kong Police, Police Commissioner Chris Tang had issued promotion letters to 20 staff, and presented appreciation certificates to two policemen on Sep 4.

Apart from David Jordan, Chief Superintendents Lui Kam Ho and Kong Hok-Lai are promoted as Assistant Commissioners, the former as Regional Commander of Kowloon East and the latter as Deputy Commissioner of Police (National Security).

Former chairmen of Demosistō Nathan Law said he was very disappointed about the promotion as the “black evil cop”, stating that the Hong Kong Police was virtually encouraging them to continue their wrong deeds.

Law said he would continue to work with Luke de Pulford, commissioner of the British Conservative Party's human rights commission, to prepare a private prosecution of the British Hong Kong police. He hoped a certain level of punishment, the least of which was criticized by name, would be exerted on them through the British judicial system.

**Rupert Dover expected in the list of private prosecution**

Early this month, Luke de Pulford stated that the crowdfunding for the private prosecution had met its target, in which 4,500 people had donated 200,000 pounds. Nathan Law and Luke de Pulford did not mention the list of Hong Kong police inside this prosecution. It is expected that Regional Commander of New Territories South Rupert Dover (who had ordered the use of tear gas to disperse demonstrators outside CITIC Tower at June 12 last year), Senior Superintendent of Police Justin Shave and Regional Commander of New Territories South Patrick Laidler will be included.

**David Jordan’s village house suspected illegal construction**

In May, David Jordan was disclosed of having an illegally constructed glass canopy in his village house at Sai Kung Tin Liu No.46; and suspected of occupying government land to build his private garden. The Lands Department also stated that Rupert Dover lives in a licensed structure in Sai Kung Pik Shui Sun Tsuen with unauthorised structure, which violated the terms.
