On Tuesday (8 September), State-owned media Global Times chief editor Hu Xijin said Beijing will sanction senior US officials who visit Taiwan, and American companies which they have ties with.

His comment came after last month's visit of Alex Azar, United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, to visit Taiwan. Azar is the first US secretary in the cabinet to visit Taiwan in six years.

Global Times quoted a Taiwan media that the Taiwan government is actively pushing Wilbur Ross, US Secretary of Commerce and even Keith Krach, Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment for visit.

In his Twitter post, Hu claimed the Americans who challenged China on the Taiwan issue will never be allowed to enter Chinese mainland and US companies they have ties with will also lose Chinese mainland market.

> Based on what I know, China will sanction senior US officials who visit Taiwan, and American companies which they have ties with. They will never be allowed to enter Chinese mainland and US companies they have ties with will also lose Chinese mainland market.

“The Chinese will remember you forever,” Hu warned in a separate post on Weibo. “You should never come to China because you are not welcomed.”
