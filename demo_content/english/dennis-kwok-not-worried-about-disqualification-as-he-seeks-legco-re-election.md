As the nomination of the 2020 Legislative Council is now open, lawmaker Dennis Kwok Wing-hang from the Civic Party, who represents the legal function constituency in the Legco, on Monday (20/7) submitted papers seeking re-election for the seat, saying he would follow the election procedures to sign a confirmation letter to show unity with other pro-democracy candidates in the function constituencies of the legislature.

Submitting the nomination form at the government headquarters in the morning, Kwok noted that quite a number of pan-democratic candidates in the functional constituencies intend to sign the confirmation letter, saying he would sign it to demonstrate the unity with those pan-dems.

Kwok believe whether the confirmation letter is to be signed should not become a talking point in the Legco election. People in Hong Kong would not bother about trifles and can see clearly the current political environment, according to Kwok.

The legislator also believes citizens in the city have all witnessed the values the pan-democratic lawmakers defended during the past eight years.

In April, Kwok was slammed by the State Council’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and Beijing’s Liaison Office Beijing, which accused him of breaching his lawmaker oath, when he presided the election of Legco’s House Committee to elect a chairperson but failed for a period of over six months.

Kwok told the media on Monday morning that he is not worried about being ousted from candidacy for the upcoming Legco election, saying that it does not matter whether there is worry about disqualification.

Rumour has it that a legal heavyweight would be a “Plan B” candidate for Kwok. In response, Kwok said there is currently no need to discuss that.

He said the next step would be decided upon whether the returning officer would issue a letter to him to follow up on his nomination.

The Civic Party will strive to seize more than half of the Legco seats, called “the 35+ plan”, so as to make use of rights given by the Basic Law to make the government respond to people’s demands, Kwok added.

The upcoming Legco election will be held on September 6, with its nomination now running until July 31.

In related news, Wong Ho-wa, a software engineer, also on Monday morning submitted his nomination form to seek election for the information technology sector seat in the Legco.

Wong, accompanied by incumbent lawmaker for the information sector Charles Mok Nai-kwong, met the media on Sunday (19/7) to announce his bid to run in the Legco race for the information sector, saying he hopes to win the seat for the pan-democratic camp.
