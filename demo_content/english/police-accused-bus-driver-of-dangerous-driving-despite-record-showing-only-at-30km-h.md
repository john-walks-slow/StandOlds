The New World First Bus driver whom police detained for “dangerous driving” during the protest on Sunday (6 September) was only going at 30km per hour, according to the vehicle’s record. It is well below the road’s upper limit of 50km/h.

Lam Kam-biu, the chairman of the New World First Bus Company Staff union, revealed that record in Commercial Radio’s interview this morning (9 September). The 37-year-old driver was originally arrested for ‘unreasonable honking’ and speeding at Yau Ma Tei while driving the 970 route bound for Cyberport.

Lam said: “The video speaks for itself. There is no cheating as we have the record that shows the driver did not drive close to the police in high speed.”

Based on the video, he noted the driver had honked 3 times: the first for seeing a person walking on the road; the second for a person getting close to the bus; and the third for changing to fast lane in order to avoid the police.

“It’s normal to honk for seeing people coming out (onto the road), and stops as he was ordered,” said Lam, who also sees the driver’s explanation reasonable.

In response to whether the driver is driving dangerously, Lam replied, “It depends on how the police claims, perhaps the driver has really scared them.”

According to the Road Traffic Ordinance, Lam suggested drivers can sound their horns if there is perceived to be a road hazard. “I don’t know why the police accussed him of honking without a reason.” 

The driver is now feeling fine, said Lam, who suggested that he took a two-week off. “It is worried that he would be frightened against policemen. The company told him if he is okay, he could resume at anytime.”

The driver was also accussed of possessing offensive weapon, after a spanner was found in his bag. As told by Lam earlier, bus drivers might bring small spanners on their duty for adjusting the rear-view mirrors.

He added, “I don’t know how the police will deal with this (spanner).”

Lam says that the company understands spanners are needed for adjusting rear-view mirrors. The company will provide sufficient support to the driver; the legal department has already asked a lawyer to contact with the driver.

Originally the police charged him for “provoking” and “unreasonable honking” but later changed their wordings to “dangerous driving” and “in possession of offensive weapon”. They also suspected the driver getting too close to the police in high speed at one point.
