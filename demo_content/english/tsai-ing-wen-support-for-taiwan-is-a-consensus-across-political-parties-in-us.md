With the counting of votes for the U S election drawing to the final stage, Joe Biden from the Democratic Party is now leading the race after securing votes from some wavering states, while Trump plans to challenge the legitimacy of the voting results. Tsai Ing-wen, the President of Taiwan, expressed her confidence that the US’s support for Taiwan has already obtained cross-party consensus, and that the continued close relationship between Taiwan and US will not change regardless of the outcome of the election.

Tsai posted on Facebook today in response to the US election, saying that the Taiwanese and US governments, the Senate and the House of Representative, the two majority parties and think-tanks, as well as community groups, have always maintained close contact. ‘Regardless of the election outcome, these will not change. Based on this understanding, we will continue to deepen our relationship with the US.’

She pointed out that, in the past, many proposals and propositions friendly to Taiwan — such as arms sale to Taiwan — have obtained the cross-party support in both the House of Representatives and the Senate in the US. ‘After the election, although there will be some changes in the electoral seats across the House and the Senate, but the support for Taiwan will not lessen.’

She also pointed out that the ‘support for Taiwan’ has already achieved consensus within the community in the US as well as across different political parties. So Taiwan will further foster the support from the majority in the US, and to promote the relationship between Taiwan and the US based on mutual benefits and values.
