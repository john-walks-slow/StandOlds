The University of Hong Kong plans to recruit two scholars from Tsinghua University as vice-presidents, as sources told Stand News. At least one of the candidates is a member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

Based on the recommendations of the selection committee led by the University President Zhang Xiang (張翔), Max Shen Zuojun (申作軍), Chair of Department of Industrial Engineering from Tsinghua University, and Gong Peng (宮鵬), Chair of Department of Earth System Science, are proposed to fill the role of vice-presidents for research and academic development respectively.

The University Council will meet next Tuesday (27 October) to discuss the recommendations. If approved, the 5 -year appointment of these two scholars will come into effect in January next year.

Until yesterday, webpage of Tsinghua University’s Faculty of Industrial Sciences indicated that Shen is a CPP member. However, Shen’s name was already removed from the list as seen today. As source told Stand News, the selection committee led by Zhang Xiang recommended Shen Zuojun to take up the role of Vice-President for Research.

On the other hand, Gong Peng was nominated for the role of Vice-President for Academic Development, a new role expected to serve the functions of the existing Vice-President for Academic Staffing and Resources. Johannes Chan Man-mun, former Dean of the Faculty of Law was recommended to take up the post in 2015 but the decision was delayed and eventually rejected by the University Council. Terry Au Kit-fong was chosen instead and she will complete her service at the end of this year.
