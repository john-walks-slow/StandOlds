Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong Chi-fung on Friday (10/7) called on citizens in Hong Kong to vote enthusiastically in primaries for the Legislative Council election in September to be launched by the pro-democracy activists this Saturday and Sunday, stressing the primaries would be a window for the international community to see defiant Hongkongers have not bowed to the regime.

When asked in a Commercial Radio programme whether people would run any risk in casting their vote, Wong emphasised it must be easier to crack down a handful of people than a huge number of people.

If only 1,000 to 2,000 people voted in the primaries, they would run a higher risk of being targeted by the regime, compared to a turnout of 100,000 to 200,000, relatively at a lower risk, said Wong, secretary general of the now-disbanded Demosistō.

Wong also pointed out, under the "white terror" created by the national security law, he did not rule out having a scenario where primaries are viable but not the upcoming Legco election in the end, adding the primaries is likely the last election free of disqualification and with free choices.

In an earlier interview with several Chinese newspaper in the city, Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Erick Tsang Kwok-wai said authorities had been looking into the legality of the primaries, and said the expenses involved in the primaries should be counted into election expenses of potential candidates for the upcoming Legco election.

Tsang’s remarks on the primaries could, in a way, raise Hongkongers’ concern about the primaries, which triggered more people’s intention to vote, according to Wong, one of the student leaders in the Occupy movement that spanned 79 days in 2014.

Wong stressed the primaries will be an opportunity not only for different candidates to argue with one another in terms of their election platforms but also for citizens to express their political stance, following the introduction of Hong Kong’s national security law that took effect last week.

The voter turnout in the primaries would directly affect how the international community would understand Hong Kong’s public sentiment, Wong said, adding that it is necessary to let the international know Hong Kong people have not surrendered to the regime.

Responding to the departure of pro-democracy activist and former lawmaker Nathan Law Kwun-chung, who was once chairman of Demosistō, Wong described his move as a big and difficult decision.

Different people have their choices under the national security law of the city, Wong said, adding that people perform their duties in their respective roles.

Wong believes, in a situation where people could be convicted because of their expression, there is a need for some to continue to tell the truth and fight for concern in the international community.

It is not the case that there is no room for defiance, after the new national security law took effect, Wong noted, saying whether there is resistance is not a “zero-sum” game.

Hongkongers can still fight through voting and spending at “yellow shops”, which refer to businesses deemed supportive of protests that have been gripping the city since last year, he added.
