Aegis (保護傘), a Taipei restaurant that hires Hong Kong protestors on exile, was splashed with chicken manure by a masked individual today (16 October).

According to Eye News, that individual, wearing black clothes and a black cap, rushed into the restaurant at lunchtime and splashed chicken manure over the staff, counters and kitchen cabinets, then fled quickly.

There were two tables of customers in the restaurant at that time. The incident happened too quickly for the staff to respond to it or to identify the attacker, yet it was apparently done by a man and the kitchen seemed to be the target, according to the staff.

All utensils in the restaurant have to be thrown away. Aegis apologized on its Facebook that the restaurant would not be open today and tomorrow “owing to emergency reasons”.

The anti-extradition movement broke out in Hong Kong last year and some protestors have fled to Taiwan.

Located near the National Taiwan University in Taipei, Aegis came into operation in April 2020, hired more than a dozen of exiled protestors aged from 15 to 20 years old. The restaurant was initiated by Daniel Wong Kwok-tung, a Hong Kong lawyer who assists arrested protestors.

In recent years, Hong Kong pro-democracy figures including bookseller Lam Wing-kee and singer Denise Ho Wan-see have been attacked by pro-China individuals in Taiwan, while an attempt in 2017 to attack former Demosistō Secretary-General Joshua Wong Chi-fung during a demostration against his arrival at Taipei failed.
