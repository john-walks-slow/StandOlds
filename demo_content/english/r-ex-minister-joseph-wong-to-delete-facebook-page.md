Joseph Wong Wing-ping, a former secretary for the civil service, on Wednesday (15/7) morning said he decided to delete his social media page permanently, citing a reason for protecting the personal data of those Facebook users that visited his official page.

On a post on [his official Facebook page](http://web.archive.org/web/20210929050926/http://www.facebook.com/JosephWWP), Wong said he decided to delete the page permanently, which will come into effect later, to “ensure that the personal data of those netizens who logged in to the page will not be intercepted.”

Wong said in the post, whatever Hong Kong will become and wherever Hongkongers will be, he hoped, everyone is proud of the identity of genuine Hong Kong people. Hongkongers need to live up to their conscience in all circumstances, he added.

He will stand with those Hong Kong young people who have lofty aspirations, Wong wrote.

He hoped the Hong Kong young people can handle all things with caution, he said in the post, reminding them not to be impulsive and to stay well, so that the ultimate goal can be achieved.

Wong added he would continue to write his columns for AM730, a local Chinese newspaper, and the Yahoo Hong Kong platform, until he is asked to stop.

Wong has been vocal in commenting on politics and social affairs ever since he retired from public service. In June, before Hong Kong’s national security law took effect, with respect to the issue of the national security law, he asked in a Facebook post whether the city still maintains “one country, two systems” if it is implemented.

Launched in August 2015, Wong’s official Facebook page currently has more than 37,000 followers, as of Wednesday evening.
