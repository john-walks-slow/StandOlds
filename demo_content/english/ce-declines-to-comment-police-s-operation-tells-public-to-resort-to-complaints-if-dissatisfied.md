A 12-year-old female student was pinned down by a policeman to the ground by his knee as she was passing by Mongkok, where netizens organised a march on 6 September. A bus driver was also charged for possession of offensive weapon as he had a spanner with him.

Asked this morning (8 September) whether the police’s approach was inappropriate as the two incidents stirred up much controversy among the public, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, the HKSAR Chief Executive, responded that “it will not be right for the Chief Executive to give an opinion” on the law enforcement agencies’ actual operation on the ground, however assuring that every complaint in terms of the actions taken will be fully investigated.

On Sunday (6 September), the police mobilised their forces along Mongkok and Jordan areas, and arrested around 300 people during a march initiated by netizens. 

That afternoon, a scared 12-year-old girl was pinned down to the ground on Sai Yeung Choi Street South by a policeman and restrained by his knee as she tried to run away. She was eventually charged for not observing the gathering restrictions order. 

The girl’s mother told media that her daughter and son were just going to Mongkok for painting materials. She was furious at the violence of the police.

In the same afternoon, a bus driver of New World First Bus was arrested by the police for ‘unreasonable honking’ when driving along Nathan Road. Later, the police charged him for dangerous driving. Finding a spanner from his pocket, the police also charged him for possession of offensive weapon. 

After the incident, Lam Kam-biu, the director of the New World First Bus workers’ union, explained that it is common for bus drivers for bringing along palm-sized spanners on their duty for adjusting the rear-view mirrors. 

Some bus drivers are also dissatisfied with the police’s way of handling the incident, saying they might resort to a work-to-rule protest.
