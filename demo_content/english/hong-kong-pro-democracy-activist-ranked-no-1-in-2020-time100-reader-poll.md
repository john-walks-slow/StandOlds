Nathan Law, former chairman of the disbanded Demosisto party who is in exile after the introduction of national security law, was shortlisted in the list of 2020 TIME100, an annual compilation of the world's most influential people. He is also the only Hong Kong citizen on the list this year.

Based on the result of the Time's poll released today (19th) , Nathan Law ranked first with 3.8 per cent of the total 4.7 million votes cast by readers.

This marked the second time of Hong Kong people making to the list after "Hong Kong protesters" led the poll last year. However, it is worth noting that the Person of the Year will still be selected by the editors of TIME magazine and made public on September 22, US Eastern Time. 

In the press release of TIME poll results, Nathan Law is introduced as one of the leading Hong Kong pro-democracy activists and the youngest lawmaker in Hong Kong' history. The report also said Law went into exile after the China government promulgated the "Hong Kong National Security Law". 

Ranking second in the reader poll was Health Care workers, which received the second-highest percentage with 3.7 per cent, followed by essential workers (3.4 per cent), Australian firefighters (3.2 per cent) and "Black Lives Matters" protesters (2.5 per cent).

TIME editors will select the 100 most influential people of the year, and announce the full list during a televised special on September 22 at 10 p.m. on ABC. 

Greta Thunberg, a Swedish environmental female activist won over her competitors including "Hong Kong protestors" was the Person of the Year in 2019.
