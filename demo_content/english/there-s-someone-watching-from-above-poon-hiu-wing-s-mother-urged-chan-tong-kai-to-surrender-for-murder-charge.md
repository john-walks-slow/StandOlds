> Poon Hiu-wing would have been an ordinary girl, but her story has changed Hong Kong forever. Chan Tong-kai, who was accused of killing his pregnant girlfriend Poon in Taipei in February 2018, was released from prison in Hong Kong last October on four counts of money-laundering charges. Chan bowed and apologized to the Poon family in front of the mass media, promising to turn himself in to Taiwan. However, the promise has not been kept as eleven months had elapsed.
> 
> In an exclusive interview with Stand News, Poon’s mother expressed for the first time the grief and trauma dealt to her family by her daughter’s killing and her state of mind in the past two years and seven months.
> 
> At this moment, only one belief supported Mrs. Poon’s move, “Since I am her mom, I hope justice will be done promptly so that she can rest in peace.”

On October 23, 2019, Chan Tong-kai was released from Pik Uk Correctional Institution after serving a 29-month sentence for money-laundering offences. When Chan stepped out of prison, he bowed and apologized to Poon’s family in public. He vowed he would surrender himself due to his impulse and wrong acts and promised to go to Taiwan to stand trial and serve his sentence. He has been charged of murdering Poon and illegally disposing her body.

Poon’s mother, who still grieved the loss of her daughter, said Chan has not yet kept his promise so far.

“There’s someone watching you from above. You (Chan) can only do justice to yourself and my daughter if you deliver on your promise and surrender yourself in Taiwan as soon as possible. You should live up to your own conscience.”

“He (Chan) was already of age when he committed the crime. It has been nearly a year since his release. If he is heart-felt sorry for his deeds, he should deliver his promise as soon as possible.” Poon’s mother said that she didn’t want to wait helplessly. “We waited all the time. You (Chan) were released from prison last October, and then came Taiwan’s general election, the Lunar New Year, and again came the epidemic. There is no end of excuses.”

Mrs. Poon believed that as the coronavirus cases in both Taiwan and Hong Kong had plummeted, there would be no more excuses for the delay.

Mrs. Poon emphasized that the Taiwan authorities have already set up a “single special window” with Hong Kong from the outset to settle this matter. She felt helpless as Chan ended up with asking Hong Kong police for protection instead, and she hoped that both governments could coordinate as soon as possible to get Chan to surrender to Taiwan. “No more delay.”

It had been wildly out of everyone’s expectations to that the murder case of Poon, which led to the introduction of the Extradition Bill, could have triggered such social movements and political turmoil in Hong Kong. Mrs. Poon said that her family was just ordinary citizens who fell victim to the murder case. She expressed her sorrows that the case had led to a series of social disturbances in the city.

In an interview with Apple Daily this June, Chan’s father said that his son should take responsibility for his own wrong-doings and encouraged his son to surrender himself in Taiwan, even Chan might face death penalty there. Mrs. Poon said that his remarks were stirring their wounds, “He (Chan’s father) said ‘an eye for an eye’ ... yet there’s big words but no action.”

Mrs. Poon said that she suffered a nervous breakdown as she read the interview of Chan’s father as it was published. She couldn’t help crying for several hours and she needed to seek help from her psychologist immediately. She also lost the slightest appetite for the next few days. Only a higher dose of psychiatric drugs could help her.

Poon’s family has been keeping a low-profile for a long time. Opening up for the first time in this interview, Mrs. Poon stressed the only reason supporting her so far was looking forward to seeing justice done, as Hiu-wing was her only beloved daughter. “Since I’m her mom, and that Chan was convicted of only money laundering charges less his murder charges. I hope to see justice to be done as soon as possible. So she (Poon) can rest in peace.”

Mrs. Poon also took this opportunity to thank everyone who had been keeping an eye on her daughter’s case. However, she and her family have already endured a lot and what they want was a little peace and quiet.

Stand News has conveyed Mrs Poon’s message to Reverend Canon Peter Koon Ho-ming, who has been speaking for Chan about his situation since Chan’s release.  “Chan had never thought of running away,” Koon replied. Koon hoped that both Hong Kong and Taiwan authorities could clear customs as soon as possible so that he could go to Taiwan and arrange for Chan’s surrender.

Yet Mrs. Poon argued that it was already feasible for Chan to go to Taiwan since the day his was released. She urged Chan to give an exact date of surrender without further delay.

Meeting the press this morning (Sept 22), Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said that she wished to comfort Poon’s parents, but there was no legal ground for the Hong Kong government to take an action on Chan’s surrender, as he was a legally “free person” after serving his sentence.

Lam told Koon that the government could provide assistance if Chan decided to hand in himself. Meanwhile, she mentioned that it has been the Taiwan authorities which “did not respond in recent communications”.
