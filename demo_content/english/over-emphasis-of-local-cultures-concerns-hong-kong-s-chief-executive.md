> Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor

Hong Kong' s leader sees a concern as the city “emphasizes too much on local cultures” while some citizens have been resisting the mainland.

In an interview with Shenzhen Satellite TV boardcast yesterday (12 October), Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, the HKSAR Chief Executive said that “only a very small proportion” of the population feels resistant to the mainland. However, such behaviors have been amplified by social media and news media, while people in the mainland are being upset. “I believe that such a trend will change as time goes by, ” said Lam.

Despite the resistance against the mainland of some citizens, Lam said the government keeps on offering opportunities for young people to take up professional training, exchange and job opportunities in the mainland, as well as promoting a better understanding on “One Country, Two Systems” among young people.

Lam also remarked that Hong Kong and Shenzhen must not be directly competing against each other, and it is not a problem that Shenzhen' s GDP has now surpassed that of Hong Kong' s . She hopes that there can be more opportunities for the two cities to work together in the future.
