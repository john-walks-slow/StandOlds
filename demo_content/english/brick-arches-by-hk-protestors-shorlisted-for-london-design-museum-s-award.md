Creativity of Hong Kong protestors is recognized overseas again, as the brick arches “invented” on the protest frontline are nominated for the Beazley Designs of the Year Award organized by London’s Design Museum.

These Stonehenges-like brick arches, built by bricks dug out from pavements, were commonly seen at the protest scenes used as roadblocks to slow down police vehicles. [As described on the Museum’s website](http://web.archive.org/web/20210929034710/https://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/beazley-designs-of-the-year/transport/brick-arches), when the brick arches are struck by a wheel, the top brick falls down and form a buttress with the two remaining bricks that hinders the vehicle from moving forward.

Along with the brick arches from Hong Kong, a see-saw across the border wall between US and Mexico USA and Mexico, and an immersive bus stop in Sweden are also shortlisted in the “transport” category of the Award. [The nominees are now open for public vote.](http://web.archive.org/web/20210929034710/https://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/beazley-designs-of-the-year/transport/)
