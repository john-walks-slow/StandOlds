Various concerned organisations in Taiwan have initiated a demonstration in solidarity with Hong Kong this Sunday (25th October), with its slogan ‘the world in solidarity demands for the release of the detained Hong Kongers’. They also advocate for the provision of a human rights court in Asia Pacific at APEC and are against the Hong Kong National Security Law.

In late August, 12 Hong Kongers were allegedly caught by the Chinese coast guards when they fled to Taiwan via a speedboat, and have been detained at the Shenzhen Yantian Detention Center since then for 62 days.

The authorities have denied these detained Hong Kongers the rights to see their own lawyers hired by their families. The incident has caused international concern. A variety of organisations from over 30 cities across the world will host assemblies or demonstrations in solidarity with Hong Kong from 23 to 25 October.

On Sunday, the demonstrations in Taiwan in solidarity with Hong Kong is initiated by the Hong Kong Outlanders, Taiwan Association for Human Rights, Economic Democracy Union and Judicial Reform Foundation. In support of the 12 HKers Detained in Shenzhen from Concern Group, the demonstrations will start at 2pm on 25 October, departing from the Zhongxiao Fuxing metro station in Taipei, and will proceed to the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office where the protestors will reiterate their request to release the 12 Hong Kongers being detained, and to call for an end of secret jail.

They also demand that the detainees should have the rights to see their lawyers hired by the families, and for the authorities to disclose the list of lawyers representing the government, as well as the radar records of ships in Chinese waters.

Yesterday (22 October), the organiser convened a local press conference, calling for the Taiwan community to show their support by wearing yellow or black clothes, or to bring along yellow raincoats or umbrellas to join the demonstration.

Lee Pon-hsuan, president of the Hong Kong Outlanders, remarked that this demonstration is planned to take place at a time when the 12 Hong Kongers have been secretly detained by Chinese authorities for two months, in response to the actions all over the world to urge the Chinese government to release these Hong Kongers.

According to Lee, the apparent lack of transparency of the judicial process in the Mainland, a rigged process of trials and the use of torture have sparked great concern towards the situation of the 12 detained Hong Kongers. From previous experiences, “international concern is inevitably the most effective way to guarantee the safety of these people and their early release”.

Lee also hoped that the Taiwanese government can fully implement its pledge to Hong Kong. In face of the crisis, the government should give aid to those Hong Kong people who come to Taiwan in different ways to seek help. She asked the Taiwanese government to “save as many as they can, and in time set up a clear system to protect the confidentiality of these people’s identities as well as their human rights in Taiwan”.

At a press conference, Sang Pu, a HK political commentator, criticised China for their violation of human rights, as it secures its own lawyer to represent the authorities, while at the same time denying the detained persons the rights to meet with their own lawyers, including a 16-year-old protestor who could not even hire a lawyer to represent himself.

Sang Pu felt that it is only through stirring up international concern that one can influence how China treats these detained Hong Kongers.
