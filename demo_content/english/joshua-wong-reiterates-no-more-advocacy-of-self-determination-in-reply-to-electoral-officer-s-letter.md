Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong Chi-fung on Monday (July 27) on his Facebook page [replied](http://web.archive.org/web/20210929050048/http://www.facebook.com/200976479994868/posts/3185147718244381/?d=n) to questions of Kowloon East electoral officer Alice Choi Man-kwan after the secretary general of the now-disbanded Demosistō was given a letter by the electoral officer. 

Choi on Sunday (July 26) sent a letter consisting of those questions and annexes asking Wong to clarify some of his political views. Wong posted a Facebook post including a lengthy written response on the social media page on Monday morning.

In the primaries for the upcoming Legislative Council election held by the pro-democracy camp about two weeks ago, Wong won the poll in the Kowloon East constituency in the primaries. More than 610,000 residents in Hong Kong cast their ballots in the primaries.

The young activist said on his Facbook that he had submitted a written reply comprising 28 points answering seven questions together with 10 annexes sent by Choi, after consulting his lawyer for legal advice.

Wong noted that the electoral officer accused him of colluding foreign forces in a preconceived manner, and that she purposefully ignored that the now-disbanded Demosistō changed its motto and no longer advocated self-determination.

Wong said Choi was seemingly attempting to “cook up” charges under Hong Kong’s national security law, rather than reviewing his eligibility to run in the Legco race in September.

He also had got a strong feeling that he was seemingly invited by the national security office to give a written testimony, rather than simply defending the validity of his nomination, when writing his reply to the returning officer. "I cannot rule out this document will be key to the national security scrutiny in the future,” Wong said.

Wong speculated that Choi allegedly plotted to disqualify him and carry out scrutiny on his ideology. “Her political intent is already very obvious,” Wong said.

In his reply, Wong said his decision to apply to run in the Legco election is not related to his identity and duties in Demosistō; therefore Choi’s consideration of his ties with Demosistō did not apply to the validity of Wong’s nomination.

His announcement of quitting Demosistō on June 30, 2020 to implement his beliefs showed he did not have an intention nor practical action to continue to push forward what Demosistō advocated after he quit the group, which was disbanded while the group’s affairs also ended.

Saying that Demosistō announced ending pushing forward its advocacy of democratic self-determination about six months ago, and that it did not see Hong Kong independence as one of the options for self-determination, Wong believes the electoral asked a wrong question or wrongly or only showed one-sided understanding of his beliefs and advocacy, and intentionally ignored/distorted Demosistō s political propositions.

Wong said he had given a statement that he upholds the Basic Law and pledges allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region when he submitted his nomination form last Monday (July 20), and that the contents of the statement is consistent with those of the confirmation letter. In the reply, Wong again reiterated that he does not advocate Hong Kong indpendence and self-determination.

In his reply to another question, Wong said he accepts the People’s Republic of China exercises sovereignty over Hong Kong and he has no intention to change the legal status of the HKSAR.

Responding to another question, Wong said he has “no ability or intention to make use of powers of foreign countries to exert pressure on China or Hong Kong. “I have never made use of powers of foreign countries to engage in local political activities,” he wrote.

Wong also said no to the electoral officer’s question asking whether Wong agreed that the purpose of his bid to the Legco election is to use the identity, power and convenience of lawmakers to continue to exert pressure on China and/or Hong Kong with foreign forces.
