Facebook正式推出一系列新的「反應」功能，讓用戶可使用許多表情符號回覆post，不再如以往只有「like」鍵。Facebook首席產品主管Chris Cox昨晚專頁發文及短片介紹這個新功能，用戶只要長按「like」，便會有一系列的表情反應顯示：憤怒、震驚、悲傷、笑臉等，供用戶選擇，但仍未推出「dislike」鍵。  
  
Chris Co指出，表情符號適用於iOS、Android及桌面版使用，周五起供西班牙及愛爾蘭用戶試用。考克斯表示用家試用反應，會用作改良功能，希望不久將來可讓所有人使用。另外，Facebook創辦人朱克伯格在facebook上提到，多年來，收到很多人要求加入Dislike鍵，「的確並非每一刻都是一個好時機，有時你只是想同情的方式。」朱克伯格提到，不久之前在問答活動中提到，會開發「like」鍵以外的更多功能，今天新功能正式推出測試。

他指出，「新的反應鍵為提供了新的方式來表達愛，敬畏，幽默和悲傷。這不是一個Dislike鍵，但新的功能確實讓你可以輕鬆地表達出，悲痛、同情、喜悅和溫暖。」

不過，世界各地的網民似乎未收貨，不少網民在朱克伯格的帖子上留言，要求新增Dislike鍵，”We want the dislike button, not this ..” ，有網民指希望Dislike這個帖子，” I wish i could dislike this post grin emoticon”

> Today we're launching a test of Reactions -- a more expressive Like button. The Like button has been a part of Facebook for a long time. Billions of Likes are made every day, and Liking things is a simple way to express yourself. For many years though, people have asked us to add a "dislike" button. Not every moment is a good moment, and sometimes you just want a way to express empathy. These are important moments where you need the power to share more than ever, and a Like might not be the best way to express yourself. At a recent Townhall Q&A, I shared with our community that we've spent a lot of time thinking about the best way to give you better options for expressing yourself, while keeping the experience simple and respectful. Today we're starting to test this. Reactions gives you new ways to express love, awe, humor and sadness. It's not a dislike button, but it does give you the power to easily express sorrow and empathy -- in addition to delight and warmth. You’ll be able to express these reactions by long pressing or hovering over the Like button. We’re starting to test Reactions in Ireland and Spain and will learn from this before we bring the experience to everyone. We hope you like this – or can better express how you’re feeling!
